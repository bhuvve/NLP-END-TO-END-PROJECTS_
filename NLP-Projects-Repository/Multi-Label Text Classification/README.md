In this small project, i have created a Multi-Label Text Classifier which classifies StackOverFlow Question Titles 
into different categories using standard ML algorithms like LogisticRegression, SVM, SGDClassifier.
I got Jacard Score of approximately 62 which was quite nice for a standard ML algorithm.
